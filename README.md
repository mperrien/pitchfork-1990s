# Pitchfork's best albums of the 1990s evolution

Pitchfork has published three different lists of their favorite albums of the
1990s.

The first one was published in 1999. It is not available on Pitchfork anymore,
but can be found here: Pitchfork's
[Top 100 Favorite Albums of the 1990s](https://www.listal.com/list/pitchforks-top-100-albums-1990s-mrsaturn).
This list was replaced in 2003 by Pitchfork's
[Top 100 Albums of the 1990s](https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/5923-top-100-albums-of-the-1990s/).
In 2022, Pitchfork published a new list of
[The 150 Best Albums of the 1990s](https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/the-best-albums-of-the-1990s/).

This page tries to visualise to changes and similarities in these three
different lists.
